  \begin{cvsection}{Summary}
    I am a degree educated Software Engineer with more than 3 years of experience in developing software for Web and Desktop Operating Systems. The best professional quality that I have is the love for learning and my ideal role is one where this is encouraged and supported. In my professional career, I worked with Java and JavaScript as the main programming languages.

  \begin{cvsection}{Employment}
    \begin{cvsubsection}{Sofware Engineer }{Diffblue}{Aug 2020 - present}
      In this role, I am writing software in Java in an Agile environment for Diffblue Cover, a tool powered by AI that automatically generates (unit) tests for Java code. I make a consistent commitment to growth by embracing continuous learning (i.e. each Sprint I study a topic relevant for my work) and by taking new responsibilities (e.g. lead stand-ups and Sprint Retrospectives). Last, but not least, I set up and maintained an online environment where the product could be tried.

I helped through pair-programming sessions one of my colleagues to transition from a Technical Consultant position to a Developer one. Managed my time between writing my MSc dissertation and the position successfully.
