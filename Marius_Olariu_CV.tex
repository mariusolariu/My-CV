		  Full-stack development for an eSource system designed to support the drug development process; the software is used by the biggest pharma companies in the world (e.g 3 of top 5 pharma companies). We heavily rely on AWS to scale up and down and thus some of my tasks involve looking at the infrastructure and trying to troubleshoot certain problems our customers encounter in production.
